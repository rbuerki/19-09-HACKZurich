**Backend for Retrieving Price Offers of SBB Trips**

Run `application.py` and `SBBHackClass.py` will retrieve prices for different 
destinations after it has received travel coordinates from the frontend (POST or 
GET with Flask-Cors). Output for one destination (random choice) will then be 
delivered to front end in JSON format.

Some documentation on API and learnings in `1-SBBHackClass.ipynb`
